            <p> Hi, my name is Briana Craig. My journey into this field starts with my hometown Atlanta, GA. 
                I started attending college at Georgia State University in 2010 and graduated in 2012 with 
                a Bachelor of Arts in English with a concentration in Education. After graduating, I went on 
                to teach Georgia Pre-kindergarten and studied to become a licensed teacher.
                <br/><br/>
                During that time, I also started working with a non-profit organization called Speak Life Now.
                Low on staff, the organization needed assistance developing their website and manage their media 
                and digital marketing. Although, I had no experience, I dove in to creating their website, teaching 
                myself along the way. I taught myself, web development, marketing, graphic design, SEO, and anything
                else I thought would help this organization with a great cause get off the ground. I wanted to
                help this organization, but they helped me in a way I didn't expect: my experience there helped
                me discover my passion for tech.
                <br/><br/>
                Once I had discovered my zeal for technology, I started a journey to expand my knowledge in this
                field in any way I knew how. I tried a few different fields in information technology from computer
                information systems, to networking, to graphic design until I discovered the one which truly
                made me feel excited: programming.
                <br/><br/>
                After narrowing my focus to programming, I decided to continue my education to learn more.
                I started a Master of Science in Information Technology Software Engineering at the University
                of Maryland University College where I learned agile methodologies, backend development, and
                project management. I also joined Thinkful where I learned full stack frontend development. 
                Afterwards, I joined a corporate programming bootcamp where I learned Java full stack development.
                Currently, to develop a deeper understanding of development, I've been teaching front-end development 
                at a coding bootcamp for two years. 
                <br/><br/>
                Now, I am ready and enthusiastic to break in to a career in IT. I'm a life-long learner and I'm
                determined to do my very best learning and practicing new technologies so I can code and design
                with excellence. </p>
